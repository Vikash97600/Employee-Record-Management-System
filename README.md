Employee-Record-Management-System 🗂️ Project Title: Employee Record Management System

📄 Project Description: The Employee Record Management System is a desktop-based Python application developed using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP (for GUI) and MYSQL (for the database). The main purpose of this system is to provide a simple, efficient, and user-friendly interface to manage employee records, allowing basic CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
